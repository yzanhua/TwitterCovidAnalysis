# Tweets Download
This folder contains all codes and logics to download full tweets using tweet ids.

## Keys and Tokens
`tokens.py` read keys and tokens from [tweet-keys](../tweet-keys/) folder. The [tweet-keys](../tweet-keys/) folder is not synced with the github repo so one safely save data there. 


`tokens.py` is synced with the github repo, so we do not put our tokens and keys directly in this file.

## Download by ID
`tweet_by_id.py` downloads data using IDs. Currently working on this.
