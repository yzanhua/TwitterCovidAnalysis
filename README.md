# a folder called TwitterCovidAnalysis will be created
$ cd TwitterCovidAnalysis
```

### Setup Virtual Env
```shell
# make sure that you are in the project folder: TwitterCovidAnalysis
$ pwd
/home/[netid]/TwitterCovidAnalysis

# check what files are currently under the folder
# download full_dataset_clean.tsv first if you don't have one
$ ls -a
full_dataset_clean.tsv  README.md [some other files downloaded from git repo]


# create an virtual envrionment named "env"
$ python3.8 -m venv env

# a new folder called "env" is created
$ ls
env  full_dataset_clean.tsv  README.md [some other files downloaded from git repo]

# activate the virtual env:
$ source env/bin/activate  # if using bash/zsh/etc
$ source env/bin/activate.csh  # if using tcsh/etc

# make sure you are using the virtual env
$ which python
~/TwitterCovidAnalysis/env/bin/python

### Setup Twitter Developer Account
The link is [here](https://developer.twitter.com/)

After setting up a developer account, please also apply for academic research access.
Details about academic research access is [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/academic-research).

You can apply for the academic research access from your devloper protal.

Note that tweet-keys folder contains my keys and tokens.  Now you can use my keys and tokens directly instead of creating your own.

### Saving Keys and Tokens Locally.

Save your keys and tokens under `tweet-keys` folder. 
**DO NOT distribute your keys and tokens to others.**

~~Contents inside `tweet-keys` folder will not be synced to git repo.
(so do not worry about privacy)~~
Currently the `tweet-keys` folder is synced so that both teammates can work on the project. Now you can use my keys and tokens directly instead of creating your own.

After saving the keys and tokens, your directories should look like:

```shell
$ pwd
/home/[netid]/TwitterCovidAnalysis

# results; show file structures, excluding 'env' folder
$ tree -I 'env'
.
â”œâ”€â”€ download
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tokens.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tweet_by_id.py
â”œâ”€â”€ full_dataset_clean.tsv
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ tweet-keys
    â”œâ”€â”€ access-token-secret.txt
    â”œâ”€â”€ access-token.txt
    â”œâ”€â”€ api-key-secret.txt
    â”œâ”€â”€ api-key.txt
    â”œâ”€â”€ bearer-token.txt
    â””â”€â”€ README.md

2 directories, 11 files
```

## Project Details
